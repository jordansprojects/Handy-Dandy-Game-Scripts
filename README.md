## VR Homework
-----
Simple scripts that helped me along the way when I was first beginning to use Unity. Most of these were provided by my instructor, and then I customized them to fit whatever we were trying to do.There is not a consistent theme or structure for them, I created a repo so I could easily access my previous works whentrying to accompish a similar task. 

## VR Final
-----
These scripts are for organizing scripts needed for our final project. We are using Emerald AI and VRIF, so most of these scripts will be interfacing with those amazing tools.
