# Handy Dandy Game Scripts
------

Collection of scripts I have used through various projects and phases of life. 



## Why does this repo exist?
It is a convenient way to keep record of my scripts. 

Some projects involve assets that were paid for and to have them uploaded on GitHub publically would be illegal. This way, I can publically share code without sharing the entire project data.
